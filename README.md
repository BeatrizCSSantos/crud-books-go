# üìö CRUD Books API ‚Äì Go

This repository contains a simple CRUD API built in Go using the [Gorilla Mux](https://github.com/gorilla/mux) router. It was created as part of my learning journey with the Go programming language.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About

This is a study project focused on learning the fundamentals of building RESTful APIs using Go. It covers:

- Route handling with Gorilla Mux
- Data management using structs and slices
- JSON encoding/decoding
- Handling HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Basic structure of a Go application

The application runs with in-memory data only (no database) and simulates a catalog of books.
